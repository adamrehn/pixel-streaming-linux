# Issue tracker for Linux-enabled Pixel Streaming

This repository acts as the public issue tracker for the [Linux implementation of Pixel Streaming](https://adamrehn.com/articles/pixel-streaming-in-linux-containers/) maintained by Dr Adam Rehn and his colleagues at [TensorWorks](https://tensorworks.com.au). The repository also contains a single release that is used for distributing the custom-built WebRTC binaries needed for each supported version of the Unreal Engine.

If you would like to inspect the actual code for the Linux Pixel Streaming implementation for a given version of the Unreal Engine, please refer to [my fork of the UnrealEngine repository](https://github.com/adamrehn/UnrealEngine).
