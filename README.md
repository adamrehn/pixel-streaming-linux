# [DEPRECATED] Linux support has now been merged into the upstream Unreal Engine starting in version 4.27.0! The Pixel Streaming for Linux project has concluded and is no longer supported. We recommend that all developers upgrade to Unreal Engine 4.27 or newer and direct all support queries to Epic Games through their official communication channels.

This repository previously acted as the public issue tracker for [Pixel Streaming for Linux](https://adamrehn.com/articles/pixel-streaming-in-linux-containers/), which was maintained by Dr Adam Rehn and his colleagues at [TensorWorks](https://tensorworks.com.au) prior to being merged into the upstream Unreal Engine. The repository also contains a single release that was used for distributing the custom-built WebRTC binaries needed for each supported version of the Unreal Engine.

If you would like to inspect the actual source code of the Pixel Streaming for Linux implementation for a given version of the Unreal Engine then please refer to the article linked above, which provides links to the relevant repositories.
